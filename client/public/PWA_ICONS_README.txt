To complete your PWA setup for APK conversion, you need to add these icon files:

Required Icons:
1. icon-192.png - 192x192 pixels PNG image

Recommended Optional Icons for better appearance:

How to create icons:
1. Use your app logo (e.g., attached_assets/IMG_20250913_000900_129_1759602426440.jpg)
2. Resize it to 192x192 and 512x512 using any image editor
